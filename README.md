# Utilities

simple utilities that I mostly made for myself

Please note: This is a side project for me and its primarily used for me, myself and I. (and a few others)

That means: I won't be adding any features that I dont need.

Modules required: [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/), [pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/), [win10toast](https://pypi.org/project/win10toast/)

Open [powertoys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and type 'help' for a list of commands.

Although you could use anything which allows you to type. Powertoys is not necessary.

This is made **for windows only.**

(Also if it opens a browser that you dont want, like IE, then add your main browser to path)
