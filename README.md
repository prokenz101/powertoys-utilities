# powertoys-utilities

simple utilities that I mostly made for myself

Please note: This is a side project for me and its primarily used for me, myself and I.

That means: I won't be adding any features that I dont need.

Modules required: [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/), [pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/)

Open [powertoys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) and type 'help' for a list of commands.
