# Utilities

A simple program made using python that allows you to do lots of cool things.

This is the linux edition, not the windows one and you may find that many features that were in the windows version are missing here. If you don't want the linux edition, then just get the [windows one](https://github.com/prokenz101/utilities/tree/main).

**Note**: This branch is independent of main and is maintained by another person altogether and works on linux(Possibly Windows as well, haven't tested). Also, you need to be able to set custom keyboard shortcuts.

## Installation
**Requirements and how to install them will be listed towards the end.**
### Method 1:
Download the ZIP file of this branch and extract it. Then, set a custom keyboard shortcut that opens utilties.pyw. Thats all there is to it.

### Method 2:
This method is slightly better but involves installing [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Once git is installed, open your terminal and change directory to your installation spot. There, run this command:
```bash
git clone --branch linux-edition https://github.com/prokenz101/utilities
```
### Modules:
Open a terminal once again and change directory to your installation spot. There, run this command:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Once everything has been installed, you are free to close the terminal and use utilities.

## Usage
Simply type a command with its arguments/parameters and click the custom keyboard shortcut you have created.

## Things to Note:
* This program, when run, sends Control+A then Control+C, so be careful.
* Don't mess with the code unless you know what you're doing.
* Follow the syntax. If you don't follow the syntax, you **will** get an error.
* A help center is on the way. Till it's here, use the help center of the main branch.
